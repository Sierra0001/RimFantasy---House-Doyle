# RimFantasy - House Doyle
This version of RimFantasy has been reworked and rebalanced to adhere to Medieval Overhaul standards. It is no longer modular and contains new/altered/removed content.


For the longest time, civilizations dismissed magic as wild fantasies and superstitious tribal beliefs. That is until one day, an incident occurred in a gemstone mine, which led to the discovery that gemstones have a natural affinity with magic, and could be imbued with magical energies to produce spectacular effects.

Since then, the value of gemstones reached unimaginable heights and can be commonly found in the most prosperous cities and in the hands of the most skilled warriors.

House Doyle was a minor noble house credited with advancements in the practical applications of magical gemstones. Unlike most other factions, they were charitable and freely shared their knowledge of the arcane arts. Unfortunately, this lead to their downfall as many felt that they were disrupting the balance of power. The entire house was decimated in a monster attack near their holding, an attack so swift and brutal that some say was the work of multiple noble houses. Although the bloodline is long lost, many have taken up arms in their name, bearing their colours as to extend their legacy.

### Compatibility

- Save Game Compatible
- [Incompatible - RimFantasy - Gemstones] The Medieval Overhaul Edition supersedes the original series for usage with Medieval Overhaul. Will cause game breaking issues if used together.
- [Moderate Incompatibility - Simple Sidearms] Overrides the way bladelink weapons work and breaks the no-bond mechanics of arcane weapons. "Allow use of blocked weapons" can be turned on in settings as a workaround.
